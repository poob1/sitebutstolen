# Hi there!

I'm **Beef**, a developer from Britain. I love to build innovative new things, and I am generally a friendly person.

    <AttributeCard icon="round-person" text="he/him" />
    <AttributeCard icon="round-school" text="Studying Computer Science" />
    <AttributeCard icon="round-translate" text="Fluent in English and learning German" />
</div>

## Programming

I mostly develop in **TypeScript** and **JavaScript**. I am versed in both frontend development as well as backend development, my preference. Building projects for fun is my passion, and you can find my work on the [Projects](/projects) page of this site.

## Android

Another of my hobbies is modding Android phones, i.e. rooting, installing custom ROMs, and any other shenanigans related to the OS. Currently, I use a Google Pixel 7 and a Google Pixel Watch. However, I also have several older devices, most of which I have revived by installing custom software.

## Hardware

I also enjoy building PCs and modifying other hardware - both of the PCs I use on a daily basis were built by me. For anything I may need a server for, I use a Raspberry Pi 3B. It's not the most powerful thing in the world, but it does the job!
